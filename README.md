# TunnelMan
Mining Mania is a 2D underground mining game developed in C++. It features a dynamic underground world, player-controlled character (TunnelMan), AI-controlled NPCs (Protestors), and various game objects (Boulders, Gold Nuggets, Barrels). The game showcases my proficiency in C++ programming, game development, and algorithm design.
